## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: Focus on stability over features — verify current code works before adding more
- [Init]: Keep existing architecture — no refactoring during stability milestone

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

From research (SUMMARY.md):
- Status quiz influence on output needs verification (may not actually affect AI prompt)
- Gemini API key exposed client-side (mitigated with rate limiting, full fix deferred to v2)
- Subscription cleanup may be incomplete (needs testing in Phase 4)
